A collection of simple lesson plans used to demonstrate concepts from the full stack curriculum

##Description

As an assistant instructor in the full stack program my goal is to reinforce the instructor and curriculum. As such I take individual and group problems and troubleshoot them constantly. In doing so, I have noticed that certain concepts repeatedly come up, often because they are introduced amongst complexity. These examples here represent distilling these concepts into their simplest form so I can students through core concepts and build on them from the ground up.
